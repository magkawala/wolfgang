        <p>Wolfgang Weingart is known by many as the father of New Age typography. His work has its roots in Swiss Typography, yet it bends the rules and standards of the time to create more experimental work that spawned the New Wave movement. This essay will explore what inspired Weingart’s work and his distinct and influential style.</p>

        <p>Wolfgang Weingart was born in February 1941 in a small village in Germany, near the Swiss border. Growing up in the countryside during the end of World War 2, much of his early childhood consisted of sheltering from air raids in the basement, watching nearby towns be destroyed in the distance.

        In 1947, Weingart started primary school. He immediately knew school was not for him, constantly getting in trouble for cheating or failing classes throughout his time in school. Around this time he discovered his passion for design when one day while he was out riding his motorbike he crashed into a wire fence, and while bending the wire back into shape he ended up bending it into different shapes such as a house or landscape. This inspired him to start creating things out of various household objects, leading him to be known for his creations in his village.
            
        In 1954 Weingart moved to Lisbon in Portugal for 2 years, where he experienced lots of new cultures and visited a lot of museums. He attended a German school here, but he was more focused on creating art with his new found inspiration from his new environment.</p>

        <h2><span class="bold">E</span>ducation</h2>
        <p>When Weingart was 17 his parents wanted him to continue his education, so he enrolled in a 2 year art and design course at the Merz Academy in Stuttgart. This was a very unstructured course, which had him completing a different project each week without much help or guidance from the teachers in a variety of subjects ranging from drawing and painting to printing and graphic design.
 
        After finishing his course in 1960, Weingart started an apprenticeship as a typesetter in a print shop in Stuttgart. Here is where he was introduced to Swiss Typography, which was a stark contrast from the German design he was used to, and ended up being a massive influence on his later work. Weingart really enjoyed working at the print shop, as he said the methodical work of setting type by hand reminded him of his childhood removing and replacing parts on his bike. 
            
        He met the company's consulting designer, Karl-August Hanke, who quickly became his mentor. Karl encouraged Weingart to explore Swiss typography and to enrol in the Basel school of Design.
            
        In 1963 he went to Basel to meet Armin Hofmann and talk to him about enrolling in the Basel school of Design.</p>

        <p>Some of the works that was most influential in developing Weingarts style are these round compositions he made at his typesetting apprenticeship when he accidentally dropped a case of type on the floor. While picking up the letters he had an idea to arrange them inside a cardboard ring, and he then used this for printing which gave him very interesting results. He managed to print with both sides of his creation which led to him creating two very different designs out of the same material, one showing the letters and the other one showing the underside of the letter presses.</p>
